# 								Jobji

**Jobji** - Django Framework project about job.

Some information:
- you can sign up and sign in, account have a menu where you can create, change, add information about your company, vacancy and/or resume
- search information
- deployed on Heroku
- serving static files with WhiteNoise

This is really better version of this (project was implemented in 2 parts) [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter3 (beggining) and this one [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter-4 (continue)

**This project was a homework of course** from [Stepik]: https://stepik.org/


I've spent a lot of time refactoring this project and it worth it.

I'm new in Django and programming, and always trying to improve my skills.
